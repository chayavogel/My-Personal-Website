           <p class="text">Hi! I'm Chaya. I grew up in London, England. I'm 26 years old, Jewish, wife to the best husband, mom of the two cutest kids (imho)... and an aspiring coder. But I didn't always know that this would be my chosen career. <br> My passions growing up were writing and Physics. I started off my career at the age of 19 as a science teacher, dabbling in copywriting on the side. After five years, I became a full time copywriter. While servicing website developers and working with graphic designers, I realized that I wanted something more for myself. <br>It was time for a career change!</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">My Dreams</h2>
            <p class="text">I dream of many things. A peaceful world, where G-d's name is known. A happy world, free of pain and suffering. The ability to eat unlimited donuts and not gain a pound. And a new career in Software Engineering. <br> Join me on my journey!</p>
