           <p>Hi! I'm Chaya. I'm 26 years old, Jewish, wife to the best husband, mom of the two cutest kids to land on this planet... and an aspiring coder. <br> But I didn't always know that this would be my chosen career. <br> After teaching for five years, I became a full time copywriter. <br>After writing for websites and working with graphic designers, I realized that I wanted something more for my own career. My brain was ready for a real challenge.</p>

           <h2>My Dreams</h2>
            <p>I dream of many things. A peaceful world, where G-d's name is known. A happy world, free of pain and suffering. The ability to eat unlimited donuts and not gain a pound. And a new career in Software Engineering. <br> Join me on my journey!</p>
